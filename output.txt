"It's all about as curious as it can be," said the Gryphon.

Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?

"What _can_ all that green stuff be?"

"We can do it without lobsters, you know.

Alice whispered to the Gryphon.

"Stupid things!"

"Sixteenth," said the Dormouse.

"_You'd_ better not talk!"

"You shan't be beheaded!"

"Sha'n't," said the cook.

CHORUS            (In which the cook and the baby joined):           "Wow!

The next witness was the Duchess's cook.

words known: 272 this delta: 2 num sentences: 301
I shall be too late!"

words known: 273 this delta: 1 num sentences: 302
There was certainly too much of it in the air.

words known: 274 this delta: 1 num sentences: 303
[Illustration]  "Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.

words known: 276 this delta: 2 num sentences: 304
Would the fall _never_ come to an end?

words known: 277 this delta: 1 num sentences: 305
So they had to fall a long way.

words known: 279 this delta: 2 num sentences: 306
"After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!

words known: 281 this delta: 2 num sentences: 307
Presently she began again.

words known: 282 this delta: 1 num sentences: 308
"A cheap sort of present!"

words known: 283 this delta: 1 num sentences: 309
"I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!"

words known: 285 this delta: 2 num sentences: 310
There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.

words known: 287 this delta: 2 num sentences: 311
"I advise you to leave off this minute!"

words known: 288 this delta: 1 num sentences: 312
'Coming in a minute, nurse!

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, "Which way?

I'm sure _I_ sha'n't be able!

words known: 293 this delta: 1 num sentences: 315
That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure!

words known: 294 this delta: 1 num sentences: 316
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.

words known: 295 this delta: 1 num sentences: 317
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.

words known: 297 this delta: 2 num sentences: 318
Alice's Right Foot, Esq.

Stop this moment, I tell you!"

How queer everything is to-day!

words known: 301 this delta: 0 num sentences: 321
"But everything's curious to-day.

However, everything is queer to-day."

words known: 303 this delta: 1 num sentences: 323
Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on.

words known: 305 this delta: 2 num sentences: 324
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, who in the world am I?

words known: 306 this delta: 1 num sentences: 325
"Would _you_ like cats if you were me?"

words known: 307 this delta: 1 num sentences: 326
"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject!

words known: 308 this delta: 1 num sentences: 327
"You insult me by talking such nonsense!"

words known: 309 this delta: 1 num sentences: 328
"And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?"

words known: 310 this delta: 1 num sentences: 329
What _will_ become of me?"

words known: 311 this delta: 1 num sentences: 330
I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me!

"How _can_ I have done that?"

"Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?"

words known: 315 this delta: 1 num sentences: 334
"Let me alone!"

words known: 316 this delta: 1 num sentences: 335
Don't let me hear the name again!"

words known: 317 this delta: 1 num sentences: 336
Let me see--how _is_ it to be managed?

words known: 318 this delta: 1 num sentences: 337
"Come, there's half my plan done now!

words known: 319 this delta: 1 num sentences: 338
"Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."

words known: 320 this delta: 1 num sentences: 339
"You'll see me there," said the Cat and vanished.

words known: 321 this delta: 1 num sentences: 340
"Come, we shall have some fun now!"

words known: 322 this delta: 1 num sentences: 341
"Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!"

"Don't be impertinent," said the King, "and don't look at me like that!"

(If you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)

words known: 325 this delta: 1 num sentences: 344
"I might as well be at school at once."

words known: 326 this delta: 1 num sentences: 345
However, "jurymen" would have done just as well.

words known: 327 this delta: 1 num sentences: 346
"You ought to have finished," said the King.

words known: 328 this delta: 1 num sentences: 347
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"

words known: 329 this delta: 1 num sentences: 348
I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another!

words known: 330 this delta: 1 num sentences: 349
"Then it ought to be Number One," said Alice.

words known: 332 this delta: 2 num sentences: 350
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

words known: 333 this delta: 1 num sentences: 351
Come and help me out of _this_!"

words known: 334 this delta: 1 num sentences: 352
"Oh, do let me help to undo it!"

words known: 335 this delta: 1 num sentences: 353
"Oh, you ca'n't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here.

words known: 336 this delta: 1 num sentences: 354
"Can't remember _what_ things?"

words known: 336 this delta: 0 num sentences: 355
"That I can't remember," said the Hatter.

words known: 337 this delta: 1 num sentences: 356
And oh, my poor hands, how is it I ca'n't see you?"

words known: 338 this delta: 1 num sentences: 357
Alice considered a little, and then said "The fourth."

words known: 339 this delta: 1 num sentences: 358
"I don't like the look of it at all," said the King: "however, it may kiss my hand if it likes."

words known: 340 this delta: 1 num sentences: 359
I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit."

words known: 341 this delta: 1 num sentences: 360
But she did not venture to say it out loud.

words known: 342 this delta: 1 num sentences: 361
So they couldn't get them out again.

words known: 343 this delta: 1 num sentences: 362
"Consider your verdict," the King said to the jury.

words known: 345 this delta: 2 num sentences: 363
How brave they'll all think me at home!

words known: 347 this delta: 2 num sentences: 364
"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth!

"Off with his head!"

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

"Off with their heads!"

I wish you would have this cat removed!"

words known: 360 this delta: 1 num sentences: 378
"With extras?"

words known: 361 this delta: 1 num sentences: 379
"The reason is," said the Gryphon, "that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance.

words known: 362 this delta: 1 num sentences: 380
"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?"

words known: 363 this delta: 1 num sentences: 381
"Go on with the next verse."

Off with his whiskers."

Oh my fur and whiskers!

"Off with her head!"

And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!

Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"

words known: 369 this delta: 1 num sentences: 387
Alice could think of nothing else to say but "It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask _her_ about it."

words known: 370 this delta: 1 num sentences: 388
"Tell her about the reason and all that," he said to the Gryphon.

words known: 371 this delta: 1 num sentences: 389
"I shall sit here," he said, "on and off, for days and days."

words known: 372 this delta: 1 num sentences: 390
However, he consented to go on.

words known: 373 this delta: 1 num sentences: 391
"Come on then," said the Queen, "and he shall tell you his history."

words known: 374 this delta: 1 num sentences: 392
Tell her to begin."

words known: 375 this delta: 1 num sentences: 393
I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."

words known: 376 this delta: 1 num sentences: 394
"To begin with," said the Cat, "a dog's not mad.

"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?"

words known: 377 this delta: 0 num sentences: 396
"When did you begin?"

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?"

words known: 379 this delta: 1 num sentences: 398
Alice thought to herself, "I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin."

words known: 380 this delta: 1 num sentences: 399
I never knew so much about a whiting before."

words known: 381 this delta: 1 num sentences: 400
"There's a great deal to come before that!"

words known: 382 this delta: 1 num sentences: 401
"He denies it," said the King: "leave out that part."

words known: 383 this delta: 1 num sentences: 402
"Then you may _sit_ down," the King replied.

words known: 384 this delta: 1 num sentences: 403
"No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what's the answer?"

words known: 385 this delta: 1 num sentences: 404
"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?"

words known: 386 this delta: 1 num sentences: 405
The question is, what did the archbishop find?"

words known: 387 this delta: 1 num sentences: 406
"How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!

words known: 388 this delta: 1 num sentences: 407
"How fond she is of finding morals in things!"

words known: 389 this delta: 1 num sentences: 408
But the snail replied: "Too far, too far!"

words known: 390 this delta: 1 num sentences: 409
"I believe so," Alice replied thoughtfully.

words known: 391 this delta: 1 num sentences: 410
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.

words known: 392 this delta: 1 num sentences: 411
"It _began_ with the tea," the Hatter replied.

words known: 393 this delta: 1 num sentences: 412
"Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?"

words known: 394 this delta: 1 num sentences: 413
"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!"

"A fine day, your Majesty!"

"It's--it's a very fine day!"

words known: 397 this delta: 1 num sentences: 416
"I'm a poor man, your Majesty," he began.

_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it."

words known: 400 this delta: 2 num sentences: 418
"And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me!

Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!

words known: 403 this delta: 1 num sentences: 420
"I must be shutting up like a telescope."

words known: 404 this delta: 1 num sentences: 421
"What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!"

words known: 406 this delta: 2 num sentences: 422
"Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?

words known: 407 this delta: 1 num sentences: 423
It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying, 'Come up again, dear!'

words known: 409 this delta: 2 num sentences: 424
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like you" (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way!

words known: 410 this delta: 1 num sentences: 425
"Explain yourself!"

words known: 411 this delta: 1 num sentences: 426
"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it."

words known: 412 this delta: 1 num sentences: 427
"Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely.

words known: 413 this delta: 1 num sentences: 428
"Hand it over here," said the Dodo.

words known: 414 this delta: 1 num sentences: 429
"She ca'n't explain it," hastily said the Gryphon.

words known: 415 this delta: 1 num sentences: 430
"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on till you come to the end; then stop."

words known: 417 this delta: 2 num sentences: 431
And yesterday things went on just as usual.

words known: 418 this delta: 1 num sentences: 432
"Right, as usual," said the Duchess: "what a clear way you have of putting things!"

words known: 420 this delta: 2 num sentences: 433
Let me think: _was_ I the same when I got up this morning?

words known: 421 this delta: 1 num sentences: 434
"What else have you got in your pocket?"

words known: 422 this delta: 1 num sentences: 435
"And where have my shoulders got to?

words known: 423 this delta: 1 num sentences: 436
"Every thing's got a moral, if only you can find it."

words known: 425 this delta: 2 num sentences: 437
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.

words known: 426 this delta: 1 num sentences: 438
(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

words known: 427 this delta: 1 num sentences: 439
And Alice called out as loud as she could, "If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!"

words known: 428 this delta: 1 num sentences: 440
"I'll put a stop to this," she said to herself, and shouted out "You'd better not do that again!"

words known: 429 this delta: 1 num sentences: 441
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.

words known: 430 this delta: 1 num sentences: 442
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.

words known: 431 this delta: 1 num sentences: 443
"How dreadfully savage!"

words known: 432 this delta: 1 num sentences: 444
Shall I try the experiment?"

words known: 433 this delta: 1 num sentences: 445
"Come, let's try the first figure!"

words known: 434 this delta: 1 num sentences: 446
"Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?"

words known: 436 this delta: 2 num sentences: 447
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

words known: 438 this delta: 2 num sentences: 448
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!

words known: 439 this delta: 1 num sentences: 449
But at any rate he might answer questions.

"At any rate I'll never go _there_ again!"

words known: 440 this delta: 1 num sentences: 451
"Would it be of any use now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse?

words known: 441 this delta: 1 num sentences: 452
So she began: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?

words known: 442 this delta: 1 num sentences: 453
I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!"

words known: 443 this delta: 1 num sentences: 454
So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear!

words known: 444 this delta: 1 num sentences: 455
"I thought you did," said the Mouse, "--I proceed.

words known: 445 this delta: 1 num sentences: 456
"I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.

words known: 446 this delta: 1 num sentences: 457
The Mouse only growled in reply.

words known: 447 this delta: 1 num sentences: 458
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!"

words known: 448 this delta: 1 num sentences: 459
"We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not."

words known: 449 this delta: 1 num sentences: 460
"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!"

words known: 450 this delta: 1 num sentences: 461
"_I_ call it purring, not growling," said Alice.

words known: 451 this delta: 1 num sentences: 462
Take your choice!"

words known: 452 this delta: 1 num sentences: 463
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

words known: 453 this delta: 1 num sentences: 464
"I only took the regular course."

words known: 454 this delta: 1 num sentences: 465
"I can tell you more than that, if you like," said the Gryphon.

words known: 455 this delta: 1 num sentences: 466
"But then," thought Alice, "shall I _never_ get any older than I am now?

words known: 456 this delta: 1 num sentences: 467
"Take off your hat," the King said to the Hatter.

words known: 457 this delta: 1 num sentences: 468
"Do you take me for a dunce?

words known: 458 this delta: 1 num sentences: 469
"Nothing can be clearer than _that_.

words known: 460 this delta: 2 num sentences: 470
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats?

words known: 462 this delta: 2 num sentences: 471
I must have been changed for Mabel!

words known: 463 this delta: 1 num sentences: 472
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.

words known: 464 this delta: 1 num sentences: 473
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

words known: 465 this delta: 1 num sentences: 474
"That's nothing to what I could say if I chose," the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.

words known: 467 this delta: 2 num sentences: 475
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

words known: 469 this delta: 2 num sentences: 476
No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!

words known: 470 this delta: 1 num sentences: 477
"What a pity it wouldn't stay!"

words known: 471 this delta: 1 num sentences: 478
"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."

words known: 472 this delta: 1 num sentences: 479
Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!"

words known: 473 this delta: 1 num sentences: 480
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"

words known: 474 this delta: 1 num sentences: 481
"Did you say pig, or fig?"

words known: 475 this delta: 1 num sentences: 482
"I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."

words known: 476 this delta: 1 num sentences: 483
"What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."

words known: 477 this delta: 1 num sentences: 484
_I'll_ soon make you dry enough!"

words known: 477 this delta: 0 num sentences: 485
"I make you a present of everything I've said as yet."

words known: 478 this delta: 1 num sentences: 486
"But you're so easily offended, you know!"

And she thought to herself, "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!"

words known: 479 this delta: 1 num sentences: 488
"Just think what work it would make with the day and night!

words known: 480 this delta: 1 num sentences: 489
I wonder if I've been changed during the night?

words known: 481 this delta: 1 num sentences: 490
"You make me giddy."

words known: 482 this delta: 1 num sentences: 491
"I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where."

words known: 483 this delta: 1 num sentences: 492
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!

words known: 484 this delta: 1 num sentences: 493
"I mean, what makes them so shiny?"

words known: 485 this delta: 1 num sentences: 494
"Wouldn't it really?"

words known: 486 this delta: 1 num sentences: 495
"Really, now you ask me," said Alice, very much confused, "I don't think----"  "Then you shouldn't talk," said the Hatter.

words known: 487 this delta: 1 num sentences: 496
This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.

He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.

"If you knew Time as well as I do," said the Hatter, "you wouldn't talk about wasting _it_.

"Treacle," said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

words known: 491 this delta: 1 num sentences: 500
Where did they draw the treacle from?"

words known: 492 this delta: 1 num sentences: 501
"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so," said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.

"I'm glad I've seen that done," thought Alice.

"Let the jury consider their verdict," the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!"

No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."

You know that song, perhaps?"

"I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.

Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; "but it doesn't matter a bit," she thought to herself.

words known: 503 this delta: 2 num sentences: 509
"I must be growing small again."

words known: 504 this delta: 1 num sentences: 510
"I can't help it," said Alice very meekly: "I'm growing."

words known: 505 this delta: 1 num sentences: 511
"You've no right to grow _here_," said the Dormouse.

words known: 506 this delta: 1 num sentences: 512
"Don't talk nonsense," said Alice more boldly: "you know you're growing too."

words known: 507 this delta: 1 num sentences: 513
"Why, what a long sleep you've had!"

words known: 509 this delta: 2 num sentences: 514
"That _was_ a narrow escape!"

And I declare it's too bad, that it is!"

words known: 513 this delta: 2 num sentences: 516
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying."

"Oh, I beg your pardon!"

"I quite forgot you didn't like cats."

She soon got it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much," she said to herself; "I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial one way up as the other."

words known: 520 this delta: 2 num sentences: 522
"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone: "don't be angry about it.

And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.

And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: "'Miss Alice!

"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?"

words known: 529 this delta: 2 num sentences: 527
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!

words known: 530 this delta: 1 num sentences: 528
"We must burn the house down!"

words known: 531 this delta: 1 num sentences: 529
"A nice muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over!"

words known: 533 this delta: 2 num sentences: 530
For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

words known: 534 this delta: 1 num sentences: 531
Why, there's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all for any lesson-books!"

"I can hardly breathe."

"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!"

"I've forgotten the words."

"I'd rather not," the Cat remarked.

"I don't see any wine," she remarked.

"Perhaps it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark.

"Only mustard isn't a bird," Alice remarked.

"You _must_ remember," remarked the King, "or I'll have you executed."

words known: 545 this delta: 1 num sentences: 543
She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!

words known: 546 this delta: 1 num sentences: 544
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered," and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.

words known: 547 this delta: 1 num sentences: 545
"It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.

words known: 548 this delta: 1 num sentences: 546
"Nobody asked _your_ opinion," said Alice.

words known: 549 this delta: 1 num sentences: 547
"It must have been that," said the King, "unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know."

words known: 550 this delta: 1 num sentences: 548
Nobody moved.

words known: 552 this delta: 2 num sentences: 549
"I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on.

words known: 553 this delta: 1 num sentences: 550
Why, it fills the whole window!"

"But perhaps he can't help it," she said to herself: "his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head.

"It's the first position in dancing," Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!

words known: 558 this delta: 1 num sentences: 554
Don't go splashing paint over me like that!"

words known: 560 this delta: 2 num sentences: 555
Silence all round, if you please!

words known: 561 this delta: 1 num sentences: 556
There was exactly one apiece all round.

words known: 562 this delta: 1 num sentences: 557
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.

words known: 563 this delta: 1 num sentences: 558
"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?"

words known: 564 this delta: 1 num sentences: 559
"Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.

words known: 565 this delta: 1 num sentences: 560
"Not at first, perhaps," said the Hatter: "but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked."

words known: 566 this delta: 1 num sentences: 561
Half-past one, time for dinner!"

words known: 567 this delta: 1 num sentences: 562
There was a dead silence.

words known: 568 this delta: 1 num sentences: 563
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself "I wonder what they _will_ do next!

However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.

"Found _it_," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know what 'it' means."

words known: 574 this delta: 2 num sentences: 566
But the insolence of his Normans--' How are you getting on now, my dear?"

words known: 576 this delta: 2 num sentences: 567
"Only a thimble," said Alice sadly.

[Illustration]  "Mine is a long and sad tale!"

words known: 578 this delta: 1 num sentences: 569
"It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; "but why do you call it sad?"

words known: 579 this delta: 1 num sentences: 570
"Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.

Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.

The Knave shook his head sadly.

words known: 581 this delta: 1 num sentences: 573
The Hatter shook his head mournfully.

words known: 582 this delta: 1 num sentences: 574
"And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won't do a thing I ask!

words known: 584 this delta: 2 num sentences: 575
"I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly: "you had got to the fifth bend, I think?"

Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _your_ temper!"

words known: 587 this delta: 1 num sentences: 577
"How can you learn lessons in here?

words known: 588 this delta: 1 num sentences: 578
"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!"

words known: 589 this delta: 1 num sentences: 579
"I should like to hear her repeat something now.

words known: 590 this delta: 1 num sentences: 580
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?"

words known: 591 this delta: 1 num sentences: 581
"I've something important to say!"

words known: 592 this delta: 1 num sentences: 582
"I can see you're trying to invent something!"

words known: 593 this delta: 1 num sentences: 583
"I think you might do something better with the time," she said, "than wasting it asking riddles with no answers."

words known: 594 this delta: 1 num sentences: 584
"Have you guessed the riddle yet?"

words known: 595 this delta: 1 num sentences: 585
"I've heard something like it," said Alice.

words known: 596 this delta: 1 num sentences: 586
Alice heard it say to itself "Then I'll go round and get in at the window."

words known: 597 this delta: 1 num sentences: 587
And then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then I'm here!

words known: 598 this delta: 1 num sentences: 588
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

words known: 599 this delta: 1 num sentences: 589
Twinkle, twinkle----'"  Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep "_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_----" and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.

words known: 600 this delta: 1 num sentences: 590
"I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!"

words known: 601 this delta: 1 num sentences: 591
"You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.

words known: 602 this delta: 1 num sentences: 592
"I never saw one, or heard of one," said Alice.

words known: 603 this delta: 1 num sentences: 593
Who ever saw one that size?

words known: 604 this delta: 1 num sentences: 594
"What size do you want to be?"

words known: 605 this delta: 1 num sentences: 595
I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer!"

words known: 606 this delta: 1 num sentences: 596
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.

words known: 607 this delta: 1 num sentences: 597
"Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that," said Alice.

words known: 608 this delta: 1 num sentences: 598
"I never heard of 'Uglification,'" Alice ventured to say.

words known: 609 this delta: 1 num sentences: 599
"Never heard of uglifying!"

words known: 610 this delta: 1 num sentences: 600
"Well, then," the Gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton."

words known: 611 this delta: 1 num sentences: 601
It's by far the most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!"

words known: 612 this delta: 1 num sentences: 602
"They all can," said the Duchess; "and most of 'em do."

words known: 613 this delta: 1 num sentences: 603
It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life."

words known: 614 this delta: 1 num sentences: 604
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in all her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

words known: 615 this delta: 1 num sentences: 605
"Of course twinkling _begins_ with a T!"

words known: 616 this delta: 1 num sentences: 606
"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.

Who would not give all else for two           Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?

words known: 622 this delta: 1 num sentences: 613
After a minute or two they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say "A barrowful will do, to begin with."

words known: 623 this delta: 1 num sentences: 614
There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear!

words known: 624 this delta: 1 num sentences: 615
"Two days wrong!"

words known: 625 this delta: 1 num sentences: 616
"It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar, decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.

words known: 626 this delta: 1 num sentences: 617
"They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.

words known: 627 this delta: 1 num sentences: 618
"What sort of people live about here?"

words known: 628 this delta: 1 num sentences: 619
"But it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people!

words known: 629 this delta: 1 num sentences: 620
Only I don't think," Alice went on, "that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!"

words known: 630 this delta: 1 num sentences: 621
"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.

words known: 631 this delta: 1 num sentences: 622
"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?"

words known: 632 this delta: 1 num sentences: 623
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, "It was a treacle-well."

words known: 633 this delta: 1 num sentences: 624
"That's none of _your_ business, Two!"

words known: 634 this delta: 1 num sentences: 625
"Well, it must be removed," said the King very decidedly, and he called to the Queen, who was passing at the moment, "My dear!

words known: 635 this delta: 1 num sentences: 626
The Queen smiled and passed on.

words known: 636 this delta: 1 num sentences: 627
"You couldn't have wanted it much," said Alice; "living at the bottom of the sea."

words known: 637 this delta: 1 num sentences: 628
"That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: "tell her something about the games now."

words known: 638 this delta: 1 num sentences: 629
"The game's going on rather better now," she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.

words known: 639 this delta: 1 num sentences: 630
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.

words known: 640 this delta: 1 num sentences: 631
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.

words known: 641 this delta: 1 num sentences: 632
So they got thrown out to sea.

words known: 642 this delta: 1 num sentences: 633
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit.

words known: 643 this delta: 1 num sentences: 634
And the Gryphon added, "Come, let's hear some of _your_ adventures."

words known: 644 this delta: 1 num sentences: 635
"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which seemed to be talking in his sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I sleep when I breathe'!"

words known: 645 this delta: 1 num sentences: 636
"As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone; "doesn't seem to dry me at all."

words known: 646 this delta: 1 num sentences: 637
"Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!

words known: 647 this delta: 1 num sentences: 638
The Hatter's remark seemed to have no meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.

words known: 648 this delta: 1 num sentences: 639
"And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or you'll be asleep again before it's done."

words known: 649 this delta: 1 num sentences: 640
"Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only as it's asleep, suppose it doesn't mind."

words known: 650 this delta: 1 num sentences: 641
"Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon repeated: "it begins '_I passed by his garden_.'"

words known: 651 this delta: 1 num sentences: 642
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking about her, to pass away the time.

words known: 652 this delta: 1 num sentences: 643
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said----" the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

words known: 653 this delta: 1 num sentences: 644
So they got their tails fast in their mouths.

words known: 654 this delta: 1 num sentences: 645
"Treacle," said a sleepy voice behind her.

words known: 655 this delta: 1 num sentences: 646
He got behind Alice as he spoke.

words known: 656 this delta: 1 num sentences: 647
"I daresay you never spoke to Time!"

words known: 657 this delta: 1 num sentences: 648
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke.

words known: 658 this delta: 1 num sentences: 649
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.

words known: 659 this delta: 1 num sentences: 650
"That's very important," the King said, turning to the jury.

words known: 660 this delta: 1 num sentences: 651
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.

words known: 661 this delta: 1 num sentences: 652
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "Turn them over!"

words known: 662 this delta: 1 num sentences: 653
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, "What _have_ you been doing here?"

words known: 663 this delta: 1 num sentences: 654
"May it please your Majesty," said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, "we were trying----"  [Illustration: _The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave, "Turn them over"_]  "_I_ see!"

words known: 664 this delta: 1 num sentences: 655
"Turn a somersault in the sea!"

"How _could_ he turn them out with his nose, you know?"

words known: 666 this delta: 1 num sentences: 657
Turn that Dormouse out of court!

words known: 667 this delta: 1 num sentences: 658
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.

words known: 668 this delta: 1 num sentences: 659
Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court!"

words known: 669 this delta: 1 num sentences: 660
"It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact, there's nothing written on the _outside_."

words known: 670 this delta: 1 num sentences: 661
"Why, you don't even know what they're about!"

words known: 671 this delta: 1 num sentences: 662

"They're done with blacking, I believe."

"No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest thing about it."

words known: 674 this delta: 1 num sentences: 665
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.

words known: 675 this delta: 1 num sentences: 666
And yet I don't know," he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; "I seem to see some meaning in them after all. '

words known: 676 this delta: 1 num sentences: 667
"Then the words don't _fit_ you," said the King, looking round the court with a smile.

words known: 677 this delta: 1 num sentences: 668
Then again--'_before she had this fit_--' you never had _fits_, my dear, I think?"

words known: 679 this delta: 2 num sentences: 669
Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!"

words known: 680 this delta: 1 num sentences: 670
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

words known: 681 this delta: 1 num sentences: 671
"I don't believe it," said the Pigeon; "but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say."

words known: 682 this delta: 1 num sentences: 672
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

words known: 683 this delta: 1 num sentences: 673
"They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun."

words known: 684 this delta: 1 num sentences: 674
"That _proves_ his guilt, of course," said the Queen: "so, off with----"  "It doesn't prove anything of the sort!"

words known: 686 this delta: 2 num sentences: 675
[Illustration]  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.

words known: 688 this delta: 1 num sentences: 677
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.

words known: 689 this delta: 1 num sentences: 678
And she opened the door and went in.

words known: 691 this delta: 2 num sentences: 679
How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards!

"What a funny watch!"

But I've got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out.'

It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry.

words known: 697 this delta: 2 num sentences: 683
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!

words known: 698 this delta: 1 num sentences: 684
However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?"

words known: 699 this delta: 1 num sentences: 685
"But perhaps it was only sobbing," she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.

words known: 700 this delta: 1 num sentences: 686
"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear," said Alice, seriously, "I'll have nothing more to do with you.

He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but, for a minute or two, sobs choked his voice.

So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

words known: 703 this delta: 1 num sentences: 689
"He took me for his housemaid," she said to herself as she ran.

I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can--but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."

It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

[Illustration: CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER]  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.

"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different," said Alice; "all I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_."

I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.

"Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch," said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: "and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!"

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!

However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

"Who's making personal remarks now?"

She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.

The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

"It turned into a pig," Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.

Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

But she waited patiently.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.

They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

words known: 750 this delta: 1 num sentences: 731
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

words known: 751 this delta: 1 num sentences: 732
"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely, "for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing."

"I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never _one_ with such a neck as that!

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.

They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.

When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!

"Consider your verdict," he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

At last the Dodo said "_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes."

"Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, "Prizes!

On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.

words known: 824 this delta: 2 num sentences: 786
In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.

I do hope it will make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"

There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

"Let's go on with the game," the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.

But I'd better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them."

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking!

Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called "The race is over!"

As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.

"Whoever lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!"

While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.

In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had some one to listen to her.

The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very truthful child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know."

"It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want _yours_: I don't like them raw."

She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?"

There was no "One, two, three, and away," but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.

And the moral of that is--'The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.'"

words known: 870 this delta: 1 num sentences: 823
She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.

"But they were _in_ the well," Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.

Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas."

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought over it a little before she made her next remark.

A bright idea came into Alice's head.

"The idea of having the sentence first!"

Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, "and in that case I can go back by railway," she said to herself.

"Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid," said Alice, timidly; "some of the words have got altered."

Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.

"There's no use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for two reasons.

So she stood still where she was, and waited.

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.

So she sat on with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to the tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
